            <p>Hello! I am Sarah Binion. Currently, I am a Client-side Engineer living in Chicago.</p>
            </br>
            <p>Born and raised in Wisconsin, (yes, I love beer and cheese), I received a BS in Art with an emphasis in Visual Design from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am an active member of the AIGA, UX Book Club, ChiDuXX, Chicago HTML5, a Starter League UX alumna, and a Bloc.io Front-End alumna.</p>
            <p>When I am not working, you can find me on twitter, instagram, or listening to cool people speak about ideas they love. I believe in surrounding myself with stuff I enjoy, whether itâ€™s friends, hobbies, or a job. Please send me a message or follow me on social media. I am always interested in connecting with new people.</p>
