Bloc Chat is a site I created during my bloc.io boot camp using AngularJS to control the views and Firebase to hold the Real Time Chat data. Head over to github to see my code.

Sample Code

While writing my code, I learned the importance of informative documentation and prototype naming standards to keep my code succinct.

```
binChat.controller("LandingController", ["$scope", "$firebaseArray","Room", "Message", function($scope, $firebaseArray, Room, Message) {
    // "room" array features
    $scope.chatRooms = {
        // accesses "room" array
        room: Room.allRooms,
        // adds item to the "room" array
        add: function(room){
            // adds this info to new "room" item in array
            $scope.chatRooms.room.$add({
                name: $scope.newRoomName,
                type: "Room"
            });
            // ng-model hold room name information
            $scope.newRoomName =[];  
        },
        // removes item from "room" array
        remove: function(room){
            $scope.chatRooms.room.$remove(room); 
        },
        //shows the selected room as current room
        set: function(room){
            // toggles between rooms in bodypanel
            $scope.currentRoom = !$scope.currentRoom;
            // ability to call selected room name information
            $scope.current = {
                name: room.name,
                roomId: room.$id
        };
    }
};
```

Early Prototyes

While designing this application, I refactored the visuals with different treatments and styles to practice my CSS.
