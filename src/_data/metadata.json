I have over fifteen years solving problems with web technologies and design. My favorite things to geek out on are accessibilty and design systems but I also spend a lot of my time as Lead focusing on team dynamics and simplifying complicated ideas. If I dig deeper for the foundational 'why' of may career, I would say it centers on empowering autonomy though technology.",
